Test task I've recently done for one of the companies.

Although it is imperfect, I'm generally satisfied with the code quality.
Company staff that checked it have also approved this project - technical interview that followed has proven successful too.

In recent projects I do not just try to maintain the level I managed to achieve here, but strive to surpass it.
